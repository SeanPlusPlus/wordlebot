2Ô∏è‚É£ A random word will be generated, in this example it's `SAUCE`. Look at each letter that is in the generated word, and if that letter is in the right position, click that letter one time, and the square will be green. (Remember, the target word in this example is `TACOS`.) Thus, cilck the `A` once. And click `S` and `C` two times.
