... You will now know the answer to the daily wordle challenge. 

Let's assume, for the sake of this example, that the word is `TACOS`.

Okay, now let's help the ü§ñ solve the wordle. And see if it does better than we did!

2Ô∏è‚É£ A random word will be generated, in this example it's `SAUCE`. Look at each letter that is in the generated word, and if that letter is in the right position, click that letter one time, and the square will be green. (Remember, the target word in this example is `TACOS`.) Thus, cilck the `A` once. 

Now, look for the letters that are in our target word, but in the wrong position, and click each of those squares twice. Thus, click `S` and `C` two times.

‚ö™Ô∏è One thing to note. WordleBot selects the first word at random; so if we refresh the page and try again, another possible output could look like this:
